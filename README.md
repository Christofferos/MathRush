## How to run the website locally:

2. Run the command: npm i && npm run client-install.
3. Add a file with name: 'config.env' in the config folder AND add these fields: <br>

(You will have to assign your own MONGO_URI to a local database here).
3. Run the command: npm run dev
4. Now the client should open up in localhost:3000 and server should run on localhost:5000.
